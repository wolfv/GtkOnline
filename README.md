# GtkOnline
A 2 hour hack to replace HTML and JavaScript with Gtk and Python.

At the moment there is no sandbox or any security mechanism at all, so use with care.

Example usage: Download `gtk_browser.py` and execute with `python3 gtk_browser.py <<URL>>`.

URL is a special crafted glade file that includes `<script>` and `<style>` tags.

URL can be local or on the web. You can use the included example by replacing URL with `https://github.com/wolfv/GtkOnline/blob/master/testapp/test.glade`.
